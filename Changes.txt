 1. Book icon.
 2. Block border to 3px.
 3. Layout 'incourse' (showing modules like book) block area on right.  Must ensure that 'layout' setting is 'true' and configure navigation / administration blocks to be on the left globally.

This is so that course navigation is on the right here but on the left globally.
